<p><b> This is my HTML file that mentions all the <em>BEST</em> cars in the world. </b></p>
<h1> This is all done using HTML. </h1>
<p><u><i> <strong>This is</strong> the greatest website ever because I made it :).</i></u></p>
<h2> This website will be going over the fast and cool cars. </h2>
<p> That means there won't be any ugly Bentleys or Mercedes in here cause they aren't cool enough. </p>
<h3> Info: </h3><br>
<p> The only car companies that are able to meet this criteria is Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ferrari and Zhonda. These cars are very  <sup>flashy</sup> already, but all cars could look better with some lights <sub>under</sub> the car.</p>

<p> I don't like Mercedes because they are made to look nice but they can't even fulfill their purpose. They are <del>for rich dudes that like amazing</del> <ins> overpriced and look like they came out of an aluminum factory. They are horrible</ins> cars !</p>
