<p><b> This is my HTML file that mentions all the <em>BEST</em> cars in the world. </b></p>
<h1> This is all done using HTML. </h1>
<p><u><i> <strong>This is</strong> the greatest website ever because I made it :).</i></u></p>
<h2> This website will be going over the fast and cool cars. </h2>
<p> That means there won't be any ugly Bentleys or Mercedes in here cause they aren't cool enough. </p>
<h3> Info: </h3><br>
<p> The only car companies that are able to meet this criteria is Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Bougatti, Ferrari and Zhonda. These cars are very  <sup>flashy</sup> already, but all cars could look better with some lights <sub>under</sub> the car.</p>

<p> Deletes can be very usefull when using HTML because it can show the edits made to a file. Am sample would be: Motorcycles are so much <del>worse</del> <ins>better</ins> than cars!</p>
