<p><b> This is my HTML file that talks about the <em>BEST</em> cars in the world. </b></p>
<h1> This is all done using HTML. </h1>
<p><u><i> <strong>This is</strong> the greatest website ever because I made it :).</i></u></p>
<h2> Filling up some space. </h2>
<p> HTML is used to create the basics of websites such as this text, titles and pictures. </p>
<h3> Info: </h3><br>
<p> When writing words like the element of oxygen, some of the letters would have to be subscripted or superscripted. When something is superscripted it should look like <sup>this</sup>, and when something is subscripted is should look like <sub>this</sub>.</p>
<h4> Some pictures </h4>

<h5> HEADER </h5>
<br>
<p><small> This text should be smaller than the others. </small></p>
<p> Deletes can be very usefull when using HTML because it can show the edits made to a file. Am sample would be: Motorcycles are so much <del>worse</del> <ins>better</ins> than cars!</p>
